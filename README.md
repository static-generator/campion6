It's a very relaxing game, It can get addictive once you figure out how to progress.

It's a fun game to pass the time, with the Minecraft movie releasing next year, It's interesting and fun to play with friends.

Although the game is pretty dead, it's still fun to come back and play with friends. (It might get heated)
