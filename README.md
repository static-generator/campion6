I've been playing it for almost a week, and I'm loving the game's content so far, many things to explore.

It's a very relaxing game, It can get addictive once you figure out how to progress.

It's a fun game to pass the time, with the Minecraft movie releasing next year, It's interesting and fun to play with friends.

# 4. Among Us

Although the game is pretty dead, it's still fun to come back and play with friends. (It might get heated)

It is also pretty dead, as the games being published are often not fun or just very boring.
